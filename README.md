# shelflife_webscraping
A Python webscraping program that pulls data of on sale items from popular a popular sneaker website called shelflife.co.za
The web crawler scans the page for shoes currently on sale and stores the data to a csv file

The end goal of this project is to create a scraper that will pull data daily from the website and send it out on a currated emailing list.

Current progress: The scraper pulls data from the first page of the website and writes it to a csv file.

Next phase: Working on getting the program to crawl through different pages of the website
